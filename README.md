### 3. Installing Wand and PIL

We need to install two other dependencies as well before we can move on. 
First one is Wand. It is the Python bindings for Imagemagick. 
We will be using it for converting PDF files to images:

```
  $ pip install wand
```

We will be using PIL as well because PyOCR needs it. You can take a look at the official docs on how to install it on your operating system.
